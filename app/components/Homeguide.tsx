        <b>Accessing the Condo: </b>
        Use the side door to the left (as you are facing the building). The
        first door is the stairs, but the elevator is right there:

        <b>Note:</b> All codes will be provided at check in. There is a code for
        entering the building, pool area, and unit 252. If you enter through the
        front door, please note that the people at the front desk do not work
        for the condo and will not be able to assist you. Please use the contact
        information provided at check in with any questions! In the Master
        Bedroom, there is a bonus bed! If you are in need of an extra spot for
        someone to sleep, the chair folds out:

        When you are opening the pool gate, after you enter your code, make sure
        you turn the top of the latch away from the support. Like this:
